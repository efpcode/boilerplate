# Boiler Plate

The Boiler Plate repository contain(s) some handy, but yet needed life improving script(s).

## Why?

Why not? Just needed something to tinker with and decided to create something quick and dirty. 



## Can I trust you?


Well *you* should **never** just directly download scripts without testing them or at least look at them before running them :-P .
But in most case(s) the script(s) harmless, however I do not plan on taking any blame if something where to happens ;-P . 


## Can I do x to the scripts? 


  * Short answer: Yes
  * Long answer : YYYYYYYYEEESSSSSS

## Will there be updates

Do not know, but if needed tinkering continues.


For a better understanding of the scripts checkout the [docs](./docs/) directory.


# Thanks for the Read.
